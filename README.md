# SiteSeries - Basic Site 2

**About the Project:**
- SiteSeries-Basic2 is the second version in the SiteSeries project, built using Node.js and Express.js. This iteration introduces improvements in functionality, layout and content, providing a more dynamic and visually balanced website.

**Features:**
 - Dynamic Content: Displays a random fact fetched from the "Useless Facts" API, keeping the site fresh and engaging on each visit or user interaction.
 - Interactive Button: A "Get Another Fact" button allows users to fetch a new random fact dynamically without refreshing the page.
 - Clean and Organized Layout: Designed for readability and simplicity, with a visually appealing balance between text and image elements.
 - Social Media Integration: Clickable GitHub and LinkedIn icons are strategically placed in the bottom-left corner for easy access to personal profiles.
 - Mobile Responsiveness: The design adjusts gracefully across devices, maintaining a consistent user experience on varying screen sizes.
 - Modular Code Structure: The separation of CSS and JavaScript into dedicated files ensures better maintainability and scalability.
